<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

There are thousands of opensource projects and libraries which have become the backbone for various other projects. Without a community of active contributors, these projects are very hard to maintain and cannot adapt to the latest changes.

<a href="https://techpro.club">Techpro club</a> is an exclusive community of open source contributors, which helps you to discover such wonderful projects and encourages you to participate.

With all our efforts as the community grows, you, as an individual, enhance your skillsets and portfolio.

Our core services to the open source projects will be free forever. Feel free to contribute to our repository

### Built With

-   [Golang](https://go.dev/)
-   [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/)
-   [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
-   [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
-   [AWS SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Get a copy of Golang and Mongodb on your system and follow the **Installation instructions**.

Optional - For emails, you will need an account with AWS described in **Prerequisites** or you may skip this step and comment out the sections in the code.

### Prerequisites

#### Github Project

Github project is needed to authenticate users. You may do so by visiting [https://github.com/settings/apps](https://github.com/settings/apps). Note the **Client ID** and **Client secret**. Also, set two **Callback URLs** for project and contributor authentication.

**Note** - Create a `Github App` and not `OAuth App` because the later doesn't permit multiple callback URLs.

#### AWS SES

You may create a free AWS account for a year with their terms and conditions.

For emails, we are using Amazon SES. Please go through the documentation https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/smtp-credentials.html.

Apart from that, generated SMTP Credentials will not work in place of `SES_ACCESS_ID` & `SES_ACCESS_SECRET`. You will need to go to **IAM > Users > Security Credentials > Create Access Key**. Note the credentials and replace the values in .env variables.

Also, remember to apply `AmazonSesSendingAccess` from **IAM > Users > Permissions > Add Permissions**

The above steps are before you unlock the sending limits in SES. Read https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/manage-sending-quotas.html

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ClubTechPro/techpro.club.git
    ```
2. Set Environment variables
   Rename the `src/.env.sample` to `src/.env` and replace with actual credentials obtained from the steps mentioned in Prerequisites.

3. Install Golang dependencies
    ```sh
    cd /path/to/project
    go mod tidy
    ```
4. Run the project
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```
    Open a browser and hit `http://localhost:8080`
